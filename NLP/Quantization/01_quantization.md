## What is Quantization?
**Quantization** in Machine Learning refers to the process of reducing the precision of the numbers that represent a modelâ€™s weights and activations, typically from 32-bit floating-point (FP32) to lower precision formats such as 8-bit integers (INT8). This is done to improve computational efficiency, reduce memory usage, and accelerate inference, especially on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones or edge devices.

### Quantization Key Concepts

1. **Purpose**:
   - Reduce model size for storage and transmission.
   - Enable faster inference using low-precision arithmetic.
   - Decrease energy consumption, particularly for on-device AI applications.

2. **Data Representations**:
   - **Floating-Point Representation** (e.g., FP32, FP16): Higher precision, commonly used during training.
   - **Integer Representation** (e.g., INT8): Lower precision, commonly used during inference.

3. **Scale Factor and Zero-Point**:
   - **Scale Factor**: A value used to map the floating-point range to a smaller integer range.
   - **Zero-Point**: An offset that aligns zero in the floating-point domain to an integer in the quantized domain (used in asymmetric quantization).

---

### Quantization Process

1. **Determine Range**:
   - Identify the minimum and maximum values of the tensor (weights/activations).
   
2. **Compute Scale and Zero-Point**:
   - Scale maps the floating-point range to the target integer range.
   - Zero-point ensures alignment between floating-point zero and quantized zero.

3. **Quantize**:
   - Convert floating-point values to integers:
     $\[
     q = \text{round}\left(\frac{x}{s}\right) + z
     \]$
     where $\(x\)$ is the original value, $\(s\)$ is the scale, and $\(z\)$ is the zero-point.

4. **Dequantize**:
   - Reconstruct floating-point values from integers:
     $\[
     x = s \cdot (q - z)
     \]$

---

### Advantages of Quantization

1. **Model Compression**:
   - Significantly reduces the model's memory footprint.

2. **Inference Speedup**:
   - Integer operations are faster than floating-point operations on many hardware accelerators.

3. **Energy Efficiency**:

# Symmetric Quantization
**Symmetric Quantization** is a widely used quantization approach in Machine Learning, where the range of values (both positive and negative) for a tensor is symmetric about zero. This method is particularly effective for weights and activations that are approximately centered around zero.

---

### **Key Concepts in Symmetric Quantization**

1. **Symmetric Range**:
   - The quantization levels are symmetrically distributed around zero.
   - For example, in 8-bit symmetric quantization, the quantization range might be $\([-127, 127]\)$, where the zero point is fixed at 0.

2. **Quantization Formula**:
   - The quantized value \(q\) is calculated as:
     $\[
     q = \text{round}\left(\frac{x}{s}\right)
     \]$
     where:
     - $\(x\)$: Original floating-point value.
     - $\(s\):$ Scale factor, calculated as:
       $\[
       s = \frac{\text{max}(|x|)}{2^{b-1} - 1}
       \]$
       Here, $\(b\)$ is the number of bits for quantization.

3. **Dequantization**:
   - The dequantized value is computed as:
     $\[
     x_{\text{dequant}} = q \cdot s
     \]$
     This reconstructs the floating-point value from its quantized representation.

4. **Zero-Point**:
   - In symmetric quantization, the zero-point is fixed at $\(0\)$, simplifying the calculations and hardware implementation.

---

### **Steps in Symmetric Quantization**

1. **Determine the Range**:
   - Identify the range of the floating-point values, i.e., $\([-R, R]\)$, where $\(R = \text{max}(|x|)\)$.

2. **Compute the Scale Factor**:
   - The scale factor $\(s\)$ is derived from the maximum absolute value of the tensor.

3. **Quantize Values**:
   - Divide each floating-point value by the scale factor and round it to the nearest integer within the range of representable integers.

4. **Store Quantized Weights/Activations**:
   - Store the quantized integers and the scale factor. The zero-point is implicitly $\(0\)$.

5. **Dequantize for Inference**:
   - Multiply the quantized integers by the scale factor to approximate the original values during inference.

---

### **Advantages of Symmetric Quantization**

1. **Simplified Implementation**:
   - Fixed zero-point at $\(0\)$ avoids additional computation during quantization and dequantization.

2. **Hardware Efficiency**:
   - Suitable for hardware accelerators that handle integer arithmetic efficiently.

3. **Accuracy**:
   - Works well for tensors centered around zero, such as weights in neural networks.

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Used in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow for certain operations.

---

### **Challenges of Symmetric Quantization**

1. **Handling Asymmetric Distributions**:
   - For data with large asymmetry (e.g., activations that are always positive), symmetric quantization may lead to suboptimal use of quantization levels.

2. **Dynamic Range**:
   - Large outliers can dominate the range, reducing the effective resolution for smaller values.

---

import torch

def symmetric_quantization(tensor, num_bits=8):
    """

    Args:
        tensor (torch.Tensor): Input tensor to quantize.
        num_bits (int): Number of bits for quantization.

        (torch.Tensor, float): Quantized tensor and scale factor.
    """
    # Determine the range
    max_abs_value = tensor.abs().max()
    
    # Compute the scale factor
    scale = max_abs_value / (2 ** (num_bits - 1) - 1)
    
    # Quantize the tensor
    quantized_tensor = torch.round(tensor / scale)
    
    # Clip values to the representable range
    quantized_tensor = torch.clamp(quantized_tensor, -2 ** (num_bits - 1), 2 ** (num_bits - 1) - 1)
    
    return quantized_tensor, scale

def dequantize(quantized_tensor, scale):
    """

    Args:

    """
    return quantized_tensor * scale

# Example usage
original_tensor = torch.randn(5, 5)
quantized_tensor, scale = symmetric_quantization(original_tensor)
dequantized_tensor = dequantize(quantized_tensor, scale)

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("Quantized Tensor:\n", quantized_tensor)
print("Dequantized Tensor:\n", dequantized_tensor)
```

   - Accelerate inference by using integer arithmetic.

3. **On-Device AI**:
   - Deploy lightweight AI models on mobile and embedded devices.

# Asymmetric Quantization


**Asymmetric Quantization** is a quantization method that allows the quantization range to be shifted, making it suitable for data that is not centered around zero. This flexibility makes it particularly effective for handling activations or weights with non-symmetric distributions.

---

### **Key Concepts in Asymmetric Quantization**

1. **Asymmetric Range**:
   - Unlike symmetric quantization, the range of representable integer values $(\([q_{\text{min}}, q_{\text{max}}]\))$ is not centered around zero.
   - It includes a **zero-point** $\(z\)$, which aligns the zero value in the original floating-point range with an integer value in the quantized range.

2. **Quantization Formula**:
   - The quantized value \(q\) is calculated as:
     $\[
     q = \text{round}\left(\frac{x}{s}\right) + z
     \]$
     where:
     - $\(x\):$ Original floating-point value.
     - $\(s\):$ Scale factor, calculated as:
       $\[
       s = \frac{\text{max}(x) - \text{min}(x)}{q_{\text{max}} - q_{\text{min}}}
       \]$
     - $\(z\):$ Zero-point, computed as:
       $\[
       z = \text{round}\left(q_{\text{min}} - \frac{\text{min}(x)}{s}\right)
       \]$

3. **Dequantization**:
   - The dequantized value is reconstructed as:
     $\[
     x_{\text{dequant}} = s \cdot (q - z)
     \]$
     This maps the quantized integer $\(q\)$ back to its floating-point approximation.

---

### **Steps in Asymmetric Quantization**

1. **Determine the Range**:
   - Identify the minimum and maximum values of the floating-point tensor $(\(\text{min}(x)\) and \(\text{max}(x)\))$.

2. **Compute the Scale Factor and Zero-Point**:
   - The scale $\(s\)$ maps the floating-point range to the quantized range $(\([q_{\text{min}}, q_{\text{max}}]\))$.
   - The zero-point $\(z\)$ ensures that $\(x=0\)$ maps to an integer value.

3. **Quantize Values**:
   - Use the quantization formula to map floating-point values to integers.

4. **Store Quantized Data**:
   - Save the quantized integers, the scale factor $\(s\)$, and the zero-point $\(z\)$.

5. **Dequantize for Inference**:
   - Use the dequantization formula to recover the floating-point approximation during inference.

---

### **Advantages of Asymmetric Quantization**

1. **Handles Non-Centered Data**:
   - Suitable for activations and weights with a shifted or skewed distribution (e.g., ReLU activations, which are non-negative).

2. **Improved Precision**:
   - Better utilization of quantization levels for non-symmetric data.

3. **Broad Applicability**:
   - Used in various scenarios, including both weights and activations, where the data range is not symmetric.

---

### **Challenges of Asymmetric Quantization**

1. **Increased Complexity**:
   - Requires additional computations due to the zero-point.

2. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Some hardware accelerators are optimized for symmetric quantization, and asymmetric quantization may require additional design considerations.
